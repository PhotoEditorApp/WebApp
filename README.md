# Nostalgia 
## Server side of Nostalgia

This is a client-server application which allows you
to share photos with your family and friends.

**Why is Nostalgia? Why I should use it? What's the
difference between it and Instagram?**

1. You can be sure that your photos are in safe place
and nobody can't see them but permitted persons. 
It is possible thanks to the "spaces mechanism".
Spaces mechanism - is a feature that helps you to share
multiple photos with some people. In other words space is like
a folder with images. You can set a grade of permission. For instance,
I want to share my photos to family because I'm in another
city, and I want to show them that I see something beautiful but at the same
time I want to receive their photos because I miss them. That's why
I should set permission grade to "see and modify" to space.
If I don't want to be shared with somebody I should set grade to
"see".
2. You can rate photos from 1 to 10. It helps to filter
good photos. This is very useful when there are a lot
 of photos left after a vacation, and 
 you want to select only best of them. It's more resilient
  than Instagram approach with likes.
3. You can sort photos by the average color. It helps you distinguish 
bright photos from the dark ones.
4. You can add your own hashtags to photos and sort them by hashtags.
5. Such popular features of Instagram like photo filters a
 remaining in this application. Besides, we added a frame addition to the photo.
